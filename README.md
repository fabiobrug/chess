✅ Basic movement rule validation (legal moves only)

✅ AI implemented (currently user can only play as white)

⚠️ Known Limitations / In Progress
🚫 Login and user authentication not yet implemented (planned)

⚠️ Checkmate detection may fail in some AI scenarios

⚙️ Planned: Play as black, enhanced AI, and player customization

💻 Technologies Used
HTML – structure and rendering of the board

CSS – layout, styling, responsiveness

JavaScript – game logic, movement, turns, and AI

(Planned) Firebase or similar – for login and database features
