🔨 Project functionality
The core functionality of this project is to simulate a playable chessboard in the browser. The pieces can be moved by clicking and selecting valid squares according to the standard rules of chess.

Full visual board with pieces rendered via HTML and CSS

JavaScript handles click-based piece movement

Basic turn-based logic implemented (white and black alternate turns)

Basic rule validation (e.g., legal piece movement)

AI implemented (for now the user only can play as white)

⚠️ Note: The login and user authentication system is not yet implemented. It is planned as a future update to enable player profiles and match tracking.<br>
⚠️ Note: The checkmate system may occasionally fail when playing against AI.

💻 Technologies used
HTML: structure of the chessboard and pieces

CSS: board styling, layout, and responsiveness

JavaScript: logic for movement, interaction, turn control and AI

(Planned) Firebase or similar: to handle future login and database features
(Planned) More options to personalization and user play as black
